# Kubernetes Practice Lab

It helps to spin up a lab to handle practicing kubernetes. I'm using Vagrant to spin up three vms on my local machine and configuring them as a control nodes and two worker nodes.

I'll probably end up using Ansible for the actual configuration since it's really good at that.

## Steps

1. `vagrant up`
2. **TBD**

## References

- [Vagrant - ubuntu/focal64](https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/focal64), base image used for the vms.
